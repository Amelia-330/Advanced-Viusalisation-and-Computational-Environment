# CCI - Oxygen Poor <AR Game>
* Advanced-Viusalisation-and-Computational-Environment
* The term-final project for course Advanced Visualisation and Computational Environment  
* MY Original Work
  
  
## Introduction

* This project is an AR experiential game. The first entry into the AR interface represents the opening of the future smart home system. The background of the project is that global warming causes sea levels to rise, forcing people's homes to be submerged in water. Therefore, oxygen has become a key resource for people to survive in the water. At this time, the biggest role of the smart home system is to monitor the oxygen content in the room at all times and issue early warnings in time. When our home is in the ocean, will we unscrupulously produce a lot of garbage? Can we complete housework and cleaning tasks by ourselves?

## Interaction machine 
  
*[Start the game and enter the AR underwater environment]  
 Goal description: Let the player enter the immersive underwater space  
*[Identify garbage on the ground and trigger an alarm]
 Goal description: Set up a smart home system to detect the oxygen content of the garbage in the room  
*[Pick up garbage on the ground and create marine ecology by player]
 Goal description: Arouse people's dependence on intelligent systems, while enhancing environmental awareness


## Approach

  
## Research Problem
* 1. How to create an AR immersive playable space?
* 2. How to reflect the relationship between smart home and housework at the subsistence level?
* 3. What is the AR project development process?
